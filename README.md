<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Tiny ML in Mapping Dance](https://i9.ytimg.com/vi/3YUVTDTo-Zk/mq1.jpg?sqp=CNTs2IcG&rs=AOn4CLBiPsvQ2bGNVZvn_j-nJXj8d81hLA)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YUVTDTo-Zk) -->

The goal of this project is to detect and translate Sign Language (ASL) fingerspelling into text. You will create a model trained on the images dataset, custom created specifically to try different approaches. This may help move sign language recognition forward, making AI more accessible for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community.

This project makes use of a machine learning platform that simplifies the process capable of identifying associated gesture recognition through images. This allows the user to work with it on custom needs.

### Motivation

Some facts:

Voice-enabled assistants open the world of useful and sometimes life-changing features of modern devices. These revolutionary AI solutions include automated speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation. **Unfortunately, these technologies are often not accessible to the more than 70 million Deaf people around the world who use sign language to communicate, nor to the 1.5+ billion people affected by hearing loss globally.**

##### Technology can be an element for good, but only when everyone is included.

But sign language recognition AI for text entry lags far behind voice-to-text or even gesture-based typing, as robust datasets didn't previously exist.

Technology that understands sign language fits squarely with AI solutions and makes it universally accessible and useful. AI principles also support this idea and encourage projects that empower people, widely benefit current and future generations, and work for the common good. This project can be scaled, and support individual user experience needs while interacting with technology.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Object detection is a groundbreaking computer vision task that has a ton of applications across various industries. It goes beyond traditional image classification, where a model assigns a single label to an entire image, to identify and locate multiple objects within an image, often accompanied by bounding boxes outlining their positions.

When working on custom models for object detection or other machine learning tasks, one of the challenges that researchers and developers may encounter is the lack of suitable databases or datasets. Overcoming these challenges often requires creativity and resourcefulness so this post will focus on how to create your custom database.

## Prerequisites

This is short list things you need to use the guide. 

* Python
* Git

## Introduction and Setup for Roboflow
Welcome to Part 1 of our three-part tutorial series on Building Your Own Real-Time Object Detection App: Roboflow(YOLOv8) and Streamlit. In this series, we will walk you through the process of building an end-to-end object detection app that can identify objects from a photo. This web app was built only for images because we are using [share.streamlit.io](http://share.streamlit.io/) this is the Streamlit project hub where you can post your Streamlit projects free and it has a limit of 1 GB memory space for the app, there is a few libraries that cover a lot of that space so in another post or series I‚Äôll add more about video and webcam functions to complement this app.

In Part 1, we will introduce the project, give you a demo of the app in action, and explain why I chose Roboflow and Streamlit for this project. We will also guide you through the setup process, including installing dependencies and creating the necessary files and directories.

By the end of this series, you will have the skills to build your own object detection app. So, let‚Äôs dive in!

### Demo of the Object Detection App
This is the [web app](https://objectdetection-eduardo.streamlit.app/) demo from the project that we are going to create and build together in the Streamlit share cloud. The app Object Detection will Upload an image on the WebApp and show detected objects.

### Object Detection
Object detection is a computer vision solution that identifies instances of objects in visual media. Object detection scripts draw a bounding box around an instance of a detected object, paired with a label to represent the contents of the box. For example, a person in an image might be labeled ‚Äúperson‚Äù and a car might be labeled ‚Äúvehicle‚Äù.

### What is YOLOv8?
YOLOv8 is the newest state-of-the-art YOLO model that can be used for object detection, image classification, and instance segmentation tasks. YOLOv8 was developed by [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com/?ref=blog.roboflow.com), this model is used in Roboflow.

### Why Should I Use YOLOv8?
Here are a few main reasons why you should consider using YOLOv8 for your next computer vision project:

YOLOv8 has a high rate of accuracy measured by COCO and Roboflow 100.
YOLOv8 comes with a lot of developer-convenience features,an a well-structured Python package.
The labeling tool is easy to use and you don‚Äôt need to install a tool for that.
And last but not least is not difficult to run it also is faster than use a notebook with TensorFlow. In my case it takes 3 hours to train the model in Google Colab but with Roboflow it took me a few minutes.
### Why Streamlit is a Good Choice for Building a ML App
[Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/) makes it easy to build web-based user interfaces for machine learning applications, enabling data scientists and developers to share their work with non-technical stakeholders.

Streamlit is an open-source framework that simplifies the process of building web applications in Python. And it has it‚Äôs own project cloud that makes really easy deploy your project.

### Project Setup: Installing Dependencies and Creating Required Files and Directories
Before diving into the project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your system. In my case I‚Äôm a Windows user so everything in this tutorial is working for July 2023 in Windows 11.

For this project I have Python 3.11 but in Streamlit cloud only has the version 3.8 to 3.11 so I recommend using that range of versions and the Python packages that we will use will be PyTorch, Ultralytics and Streamlit. We can install these packages using pip into a separate virtual environment.

### Creating Virtual Environment
When working on a Python project, it‚Äôs important to keep your dependencies separate from your global Python environment to prevent conflicts between different projects, especially with Pytorch.

Make sure you already have installed Python, VS code(or other IDE) and Git. Follow the next steps:

Create a new virtual environment by running the following command in the terminal after venv you can name as you wish your environment:
```
python -m venv env
```
Then activate the enviroment:
```
env\Scripts\activate
```
The first step is getting our data set (Images folder). In this case I recommend having at least 200 images. While the more pictures you have, the better your model becomes but don‚Äôt use pictures nearly identicals. I‚Äôm using 4 different sign hand posture so taking 50 photos with any device can take a lot of time so let‚Äôs create an environment only for the script that will take photos with our web cam. In this environment we only need to install OpenCV. So run in your terminal:

```
pip install opencv-python
```
Now you can run the following script, basically you can modify the labels, these labels will be used to create folders and will take the number of images that you declared. After finishing with the first label it will continue with the next one until it finishes the labels list. And will display a window that shows what is capturing. Also you can modify the time between each shot and time between the labels capture. Start taking pictures:

[Python Script to take pictures](https://github.com/fullmakeralchemist/handsspelling/blob/master/pythonscripts/img.py)
At this point we will have the amount of images that we need but the name of each picture is random so we have to rename it to make it easier to identify each image. The next code will rename each image in just one folder so run the code for each folder in your project.

[Python Script to rename images](https://github.com/fullmakeralchemist/handsspelling/blob/master/pythonscripts/renameimg.py)

### Create a project with Roboflow
Building a custom dataset can be a painful process. It might take dozens or even hundreds of hours to collect images, label them, and export them in the proper format. Fortunately, Roboflow makes this process straightforward. If you only have images, you can label them in [Roboflow Annotate](https://docs.roboflow.com/annotate?ref=blog.roboflow.com). (When starting from scratch, consider [annotating large batches of images via API](https://docs.roboflow.com/annotate/annotate-api?ref=blog.roboflow.com) or use the [model-assisted labeling](https://blog.roboflow.com/announcing-label-assist/) tool to speed things up.)

Before you start, you need to create a Roboflow [account](https://app.roboflow.com/login?ref=blog.roboflow.com). Once you do that, you can create a new project in the Roboflow dashboard.

<p align="center">
<img src="media/1.png" width="60%">
</p>

Keep in mind to choose the right project type. In this case choose, Object Detection.

<p align="center">
<img src="media/2.png" width="60%">
</p>

### Upload your images
Add data to your newly created project. You can do it through the [web interface](https://docs.roboflow.com/adding-data/object-detection?ref=blog.roboflow.com). If you don‚Äôt have a dataset, you can grab one from [Roboflow Universe](https://universe.roboflow.com/?ref=blog.roboflow.com).

If you drag and drop a directory with a data set in a supported format, the Roboflow dashboard will automatically read the images and annotations together. To create a data set with annotations locally in Windows check [this post](https://medium.com/@lalodatos/label-your-images-with-labelimg-in-windows-for-object-detection-models-1b0a66f00a7b).

<p align="center">
<img src="media/3.png" width="60%">
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="media/4.png" width="60%">
</p>

After all images uploaded you can click Save and Continue.

<p align="center">
<img src="media/5.png" width="60%">
</p>

Then it will appear the pop-up window and you can Click only in Assing Images, in this part if you are working with a Team you can invite them to add images or labeling.

<p align="center">
<img src="media/6.png" width="60%">
</p>
Then we need to click Start Annotating in case you upload images only to use the label tool from Roboflow.

<p align="center">
<img src="media/7.png" width="60%">
</p>

### Label your images
Use the tool to select the element with the classes that you are going to use in your model. And repeat the same process for all the images.

<p align="center">
<img src="media/8.png" width="60%">
</p>

After you finish labeling all the images click the back button highlighted in red in the image below.

<p align="center">
<img src="media/9.png" width="60%">
</p>

Now we can add all the images to the Dataset with the button Add n Image to the Dataset.

<p align="center">
<img src="media/10.png" width="60%">
</p>

Now will appear the option to Add Images you can choose different options I recommend using the default option.

<p align="center">
<img src="media/11.png" width="60%">
</p>

After loading our images to the database another window will appear. You need to make sure that there are no UNASSIGNED images and the Dataset is ready, once you have it similar as the image below you can Click Generate New Version.

<p align="center">
<img src="media/12.png" width="60%">
</p>

When we Generate a New Version we can use some tools to prepare the data and experiment with them. Go to option 3.

<p align="center">
<img src="media/13.png" width="60%">
</p>

In this option we can apply transformations in all the images, so make sure to configure this depending on your project. Maybe you are using a camera in Raspberry Pi or maybe you want to use images with a specific format. For my project this configuration is perfect.

<p align="center">
<img src="media/14.png" width="60%">
</p>

Option 4 is an amazing tool because you can generate extra versions from your images that can duplicate or triplicate in the free version of the dataset. Let‚Äôs see the options.

<p align="center">
<img src="media/15.png" width="60%">
</p>

For this project I‚Äôll use flip horizontal, try to experiment with it, and depending on your project you can choose the options that you need.

<p align="center">
<img src="media/16.png" width="60%">
</p>

After you choose an Augmentation you will see extra options. For my project I only need the Horizontal. Try to check what is best for your custom project. After that click Apply

<p align="center">
<img src="media/17.png" width="60%">
</p>

Then click continue to step 5 and last.

<p align="center">
<img src="media/18.png" width="60%">
</p>

Select the Maximun Version and then click Generate and is ready to go.

<p align="center">
<img src="media/19.png" width="60%">
</p>

After this will appear the next page:

<p align="center">
<img src="media/20.png" width="60%">
</p>

Congratulations now you have an Image Dataset ready to train a model.

## Train YOLOv8 on a custom dataset
In this section, we will dive deeper into the YOLOv8 object detection model and explore how to train it .

There are a wide range of open-source object detection models available. A popular choice is models in the YOLO (You Only Look Once) family, which continue to represent the state-of-the-art in object detection tasks.

Once you have a labeled dataset, and you have made your augmentations, it is time to start training an object detection model. Training involves showing instances of your labeled data to a model in batches and iteratively improving the way the model is mapping images to predictions.

As with labeling, you can take two approaches to training and inferring with object detection models train and deploy yourself, or use training and inference services like Roboflow Train and Roboflow Deploy. Both of which are free for Public plans.

In [Upload your images](#label-your-images) we finished the Versions tool from our Roboflow project now is time to train the model. We have to choose the option Custom Train using YOLOv5 and then Get Snippet.

<p align="center">
<img src="media/21.png" width="60%">
</p>

A pop up copy the lines or save it we need the api_key to modify the notebook, will open a [notebook](https://github.com/fullmakeralchemist/handsspelling/tree/master/notebook) in Google Colab after clicking Copy Snippet. Is a repository make sure to create a copy to save the changes first.

<p align="center">
<img src="media/22.png" width="60%">
</p>

When you open the notebook it is necessary to run all to set up the Colab session. There are a few cells that you can avoid but check it first.

<p align="center">
<img src="media/23.png" width="60%">
</p>

If we remember we have the api_key and extra information about our data set we will use it in the Step 5: Exporting dataset from the Notebook we will find a code cell and we need to replace with the copied lines from Roboflow after that we can run everything without modifying anything else.

<p align="center">
<img src="media/24.png" width="60%">
</p>


### Deploy model on Roboflow
Once you have finished training the YOLOv8 model, you‚Äôll have a set of trained weights ready for use. These weights will be in the /runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt folder of your project. You need to download the filebest.pt to use it in the Streamlit app.

<p align="center">

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Creating a Streamlit WebApp for Image Object Detection with a Roboflow model
Streamlitis an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science teams. Create beautiful web apps in minutes. Streamlit apps are Python scripts that run from top to bottom. Every time a user opens a browser tab pointing to your app, the script is re-executed. As the script executes, Streamlit draws its output live in a browser.

[Create an app](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/create-an-app) using Streamlit‚Äôs core features to fetch and cache data, draw charts, plot information on a map, and use interactive widgets, like a slider, to filter results.

Let‚Äôs prepare the virtual environment for the Streamlit app. First let‚Äôs create a virtual environment and once created then activate it (Windows).

```
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate
```

Then we have to install PyTorch, Ultralytics and Streamlit. Try to install in the next order.

```
pip install torch
pip install ultralytics
pip install streamlit
```

After this we are ready to try the hello world in Streamlit to check that everything is installed correctly. Create a file called app.py and put the next code lines using your favorite IDE:

```
import streamlit as st
st.write("Hello, World!")
```

Then run it from the terminal in cmd and if everything works fine will open the browser.

```
streamlit run app.py
```

Then to create a tool to upload our pictures and use the model we need to open the code editor and let‚Äôs get started by replacing the previous file and creating a new one named app.py. But we also need a folder called weights and for the moment is everything. Now let‚Äôs go to the next step.

## Create a Uploading an Image On Streamlit WebApp
We‚Äôll use Streamlit to allow users to upload an image. After successfully uploading an image, is ready to run object detection on the uploaded image using YOLOv8. This step involves loading the YOLOv8 model and passing the uploaded image through the model to identify the objects present in the image.

We will also visualize the output of the model with the identified objects highlighted in the image. Let‚Äôs go into the code.

In [Deploy model on Roboflow](#deploy-model-on-roboflow) of this series, we have discussed how to download a pre-trained weight file of the Yolov8 model. downloaded the best.pt file and saved it inside our weights directory. We will use the same weight file. In the created file with the name app.pywrite the following lines of code:

[Streamlit Script](https://github.com/fullmakeralchemist/handsspelling/blob/master/streamlitscript/app.py)

You can modify the app text in the st.caption line codes as you prefer for your project now let‚Äôs run the app with in the terminal:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

This will deploy our app in the web browser that we are currently using, upload an image an check that identifies the objects:

<p align="center">
<img src="media/26.png" width="60%">
</p>

If everything run properly please run the next command to get the requirements:

```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Also we need to create a file called packages.txt in the code folder that and put this line in it:

```
libgl1
```

Now we can create a repo in Github to put our app in the streamlit.io but before that make sure erase everything in the requierements except for 3 things:

```
torch==2.0.1
ultralytics==8.0.142
streamlit==1.25.0
```

The [Streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io/) only allows uploading 1GB. The installations use the most of the space, so to avoid that we leave the three mandatory libraries for our app. Check this repository the folder [Code]() and how it needs to uploaded.

<p align="center">
<img src="media/27.png" width="60%">
</p>

From here we are ready to go to [Streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io/) and deploy our app. Create an account and then will appear the next window click in the New app.

<p align="center">
<img src="media/28.png" width="60%">
</p>

Connect the Streamlit account with Github and then select the [repository](https://github.com/fullmakeralchemist/handsspelling/tree/master/streamlitscript) where your app is located. then select the branch and change the Main file path:

<p align="center">
<img src="media/29.png" width="60%">
</p>

Now select the Python version and save the changes after this we can click the deploy button.

<p align="center">
<img src="media/30.png" width="60%">
</p>

Then will appear the next window showing all the installations. Check if there are errors.

<p align="center">
<img src="media/31.png" width="60%">
</p>

Then you can try your app and check if it works properly.

<p align="center">
<img src="media/32.png" width="60%">
</p>

The combination of Roboflow and Streamlit enables the development of applications with a user-friendly interface. This approach makes it easier to detect and track objects in real time, allowing for a wide range of use cases not only for Object detection models for other data science and ML projects.

## Enhancing Active Learning: Uploading Data to Roboflow from Windows or Google Colab using the API 

Active learning aims to select the most informative samples from a large pool of unlabeled data to be labeled by usually a human annotator to improve the model‚Äôs performance.

In the context of Windows, active learning in this project will be collecting data and uploading this new data in Roboflow to increase model performance. It can be particularly useful when working with small datasets, which is common to improve models.

To Achieve this I‚Äôll use Roboflow API to upload images to our existing dataset on the Roboflow platform. You can upload images to Roboflow projects using the web interface, Python SDK, REST API, and CLI.

First we have to have create our Notebook in Google Colab or create a Virtual envioroment in Conda or venv. If you are using Windows check this first. If you are using Colab jump this step. and go to the code.

```
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate
```

Then we can install notebook to open the notebooks.

```
pip install notebook
```
To set up our noteook we have to run the next commands:
```
import os
HOME = os.getcwd()
print(HOME)
```
```
!pip install ultralytics==8.0.20

from IPython import display
display.clear_output()

import ultralytics
ultralytics.checks()

from ultralytics import YOLO

from IPython.display import display, Image
```
```
!mkdir {HOME}/datasets
%cd {HOME}/datasets

!pip install roboflow --quiet
```

After this our notebook is ready to run the scrip. Before diving in to the code I need to remember that we need new data to upload. So make sure you have run the code from [Project Setup: Installing Dependencies and Creating Required Files and Directories](#project-setup-installing-dependencies-and-creating-required-files-and-directories) to get new data.

After that we now have a new data set that now we can upload our data to Roboflow using the API.

### Upload images to Roboflow using the API and Python.

First we need to check if we run the pip install roboflow. Then we need to run in the terminal. If we had success installing the library, create a new cell add the code below and click Run with the next code to ulpload the images in the folder you create recently (Just change the corresponding values of your project). The next code is to just upload one image and test:

```
from roboflow import Roboflow

# Initialize the Roboflow object with your API key
rf = Roboflow(api_key="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx")

# Retrieve your current workspace and project name
print(rf.workspace())

# Specify the project for upload
project = rf.workspace("xxxxxxxxxx").project("xxxxxxxx")

# Upload the image to your project
project.upload("/content/two.jpg")

```
To upload a entire folder use the next code:

```
import os
from roboflow import Roboflow

# Initialize the Roboflow object with your API key
rf = Roboflow(api_key="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx")

# Retrieve your current workspace and project name
print(rf.workspace())

# Specify the project for upload
project = rf.workspace("xxxxxxxxs").project("xxxxxxxxx")

# Folder path containing all the images
folder_path = "/content/images"  # Update this to your folder path

# Get a list of all image files in the folder
image_files = [os.path.join(folder_path, file) for file in os.listdir(folder_path) if file.lower().endswith(('.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png'))]

# Upload each image to your project
for image_file in image_files:
    project.upload(image_file)

```
In the Shell will appear all the information and if is running add some print to warning you when it‚Äôs over. When is running you will see that it takes a while, but the images will be uploaded.

Now we have a new data set of images to label manually and then retrain your model! By harnessing the potential of Active Learning with Windows or Google Colab and Roboflow API, you‚Äôve created a streamlined process for capturing images and utilizing the Roboflow label them seamlessly. So, time to go ahead, dive into the labeling process, and let the possibilities of Active Learning and Roboflow API propel your machine learning journey forward.

## Enhancing Active Learning: Uploading Data to Roboflow from Raspberry Pi using the API

In the context of Raspberry Pi, active learning in this project will be collecting data and uploading this new data in Roboflow to increase model performance. It can be particularly useful when working with small datasets, which is common in embedded systems like the Raspberry Pi, where storage and computational resources may be limited.

To Achieve this I‚Äôll use Roboflow API to upload images to our existing dataset on the Roboflow platform. You can upload images to Roboflow projects using the web interface, Python SDK, REST API, and CLI.

First we have to have set up our Raspberry Pi check my tutorial post [how to set up a Raspberry Pi](https://medium.com/geekculture/setting-up-your-raspberry-pi-4-wireless-f51c16937d1e). To collect data I‚Äôm using Buster version of Raspberry Pi OS, then we have to set up the camera, if you are using an official camera from Raspberry Pi check my tutorial [how to set up the camera with the OS version](https://medium.com/geekculture/camera-setup-on-raspberry-pi-4-912e7d415cdf) that I mentioned.

Once we have everything ready the first thing we need is create a Python code to automate as we did in Windows how to take photos, the code will create a folder with the name of the labels list we want, and for each folder will captures images with the camera the times we asked and as we did in Windows will appear a windows showing us what the camera see, let‚Äôs see the code:

```
import time
import picamera
from PIL import Image
import os

def get_image_size(image_path):
    with Image.open(image_path) as img:
        return img.size

def take_pictures(label, num_pictures, interval_seconds, output_folder):
    folder_path = os.path.join(output_folder, label)
    if not os.path.exists(folder_path):
        os.makedirs(folder_path)

    with picamera.PiCamera() as camera:
        # Start the preview
        camera.start_preview()

        for i in range(1, num_pictures + 1):
            # Generate the file name for the picture
            file_name = os.path.join(folder_path, f"{label}_picture{i}.jpg")

            # Capture the picture
            camera.capture(file_name)

            # Get the size of the captured image
            image_size = get_image_size(file_name)
            print(f"{label} - Picture {i}: Width={image_size[0]}, Height={image_size[1]}")

            # Wait for the specified interval before taking the next picture
            time.sleep(interval_seconds)

        # Stop the preview after capturing all pictures
        camera.stop_preview()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    labels = ["label1", "label2", "label3"]  # Add more labels if needed
    num_pictures_per_label = 20
    interval_seconds = 2
    label_delay_seconds = 10  # Delay between capturing pictures for each label
    output_folder = "my_pictures"  # Change this to the desired output folder name

    # Create the output folder if it doesn't exist
    if not os.path.exists(output_folder):
        os.makedirs(output_folder)

    for label in labels:
        print(f"Taking pictures for label: {label}")
        take_pictures(label, num_pictures_per_label, interval_seconds, output_folder)
        time.sleep(label_delay_seconds)
```
This is how will look like:

<p align="center">
<img src="media/35.png" width="60%">
</p>

After that we now have a new data set that now we can upload our data to Roboflow. Now i‚Äôll talk about the problem with the Raspberry Pi OS. What I tried is installing Roboflow in the Buster version and it didn‚Äôt work, it looks like there is no compatible version. Because of that now we need to setup the Raspberry with the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye, the problem with Bullseye is that it has a new camera library named picamera2 so this new library is a little bit tricky and the OS also it doesn‚Äôt allow you to access the camera easy as in the buster version so is necessary to go to the terminal and activate it manually. To access to this configuration we need to type sudo raspi-config. Warning this doesn‚Äôt work with VNC you need a monitor connected to the Pi.

<p align="center">
<img src="media/36.png" width="60%">
</p>

Select the option 3 Interface Options. And will appear:

<p align="center">
<img src="media/37.png" width="60%">
</p>

Then select I1 Legaby Camera enable and then Enable after this will ask you about rebooting and to have the changes made is necessary to reboot it. Then is possible to run the code is really similar to the one in Buster.

```
import time
from picamera2 import Picamera2, Preview
from PIL import Image
import os

picam2 = Picamera2()

def take_pictures(label, num_pictures, interval_seconds, output_folder):
    folder_path = os.path.join(output_folder, label)
    if not os.path.exists(folder_path):
        os.makedirs(folder_path)

    with picam2 as camera:
        # Start the preview
        camera.start(show_preview=True)

        for i in range(1, num_pictures + 1):
            # Generate the file name for the picture
            file_name = os.path.join(folder_path, f"{label}_picture{i}.jpg")

            # Capture the picture
            camera.capture_file(file_name)

            # Wait for the specified interval before taking the next picture
            time.sleep(interval_seconds)

        # Stop the preview after capturing all pictures
        camera.stop_preview()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    labels = ["label1", "label2", "label3"]  # Add more labels if needed
    num_pictures_per_label = 20
    interval_seconds = 2
    label_delay_seconds = 10  # Delay between capturing pictures for each label
    output_folder = "my_pictures"  # Change this to the desired output folder name

    # Create the output folder if it doesn't exist
    if not os.path.exists(output_folder):
        os.makedirs(output_folder)

    for label in labels:
        print(f"Taking pictures for label: {label}")
        take_pictures(label, num_pictures_per_label, interval_seconds, output_folder)
        time.sleep(label_delay_seconds)
```

Now after running any of the two previous codes to collect data let‚Äôs check how to upload this data from Raspberry Pi to Roboflow using the API.

### Upload images to Roboflow using the API and Python (Thonny IDE in Raspberry Pi).
First we need to have our Raspberry with the Bullseye version check my tutorial to setup the Raspberry[Setting up your Raspberry Pi 4 wireless (2023)](https://medium.com/geekculture/setting-up-your-raspberry-pi-4-wireless-cd3e70a53e3b). Then we need to run in the terminal

```
pip install roboflow
```

If we had success installing the library, open Thonny the Python IDE from Raspberry and click Run with the next code to ulpload the images in the folder you create recently (Just change the corresponding values of your project).

```
import os
from roboflow import Roboflow

# Initialize the Roboflow object with your API key
rf = Roboflow(api_key="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx")

# Retrieve your current workspace and project name
print(rf.workspace())

# Specify the project for upload
project = rf.workspace("xxxxxxxx").project("xxxxxxxxx")

# Folder path containing all the images
folder_path = "/content/images"  # Update this to your folder path

# Get a list of all image files in the folder
image_files = [os.path.join(folder_path, file) for file in os.listdir(folder_path) if file.lower().endswith(('.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png'))]

# Upload each image to your project
for image_file in image_files:
    project.upload(image_file)
```

In the Shell will appear all the information and if is running add some print to warning you when it‚Äôs over. When is running you will see that it takes a while, but the images will be uploaded.

<p align="center">
<img src="media/38.png" width="60%">
</p>

After it finishes you can wait a few minutes to see the images in the assign section from your Rboflow project as we see in the image below.

<p align="center">
<img src="media/34.png" width="60%">
</p>

Now we have a new data set of images to label manually and then retrain your model! By harnessing the potential of Active Learning with Raspberry Pi and Roboflow API, you‚Äôve created a streamlined process for capturing images and utilizing the Roboflow label them seamlessly. So, go ahead, dive into the labeling process, and let the possibilities of Active Learning with Raspberry Pi and Roboflow API propel your machine learning journey.

## How to Deploy a Roboflow (YOLOv8) Model to a Raspberry Pi

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need a Raspberry Pi 4. You will need to run the 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS (Bullseye version) operating system.

The Raspberry Pi is a useful edge deployment device for many computer vision applications and use cases. For applications that operate at lower frame rates, from motion-triggered security systems to wildlife surveying, a Pi is an excellent choice for a device on which to deploy your application. Pis are small and you can deploy a state-of-the-art YOLOv8 computer vision model on your Pi.

Notably, you can run models on a Pi without an internet connection while still executing logic on your model inference results.

In this guide, we‚Äôre going to walk through how to deploy a computer vision model to a Raspberry Pi. We‚Äôll be deploying a model built on Roboflow that we will deploy to a local Docker container. By the end of the guide, we‚Äôll have a working computer vision model ready to use on our Pi.

Without further ado, let‚Äôs get started!

We are going to take where we finish in [Deploy model on Roboflow](#deploy-model-on-roboflow) from this repo where we have successfully trained our model. When the aforementioned deploy() function in your code, the weights were uploaded to Roboflow and the model was deployed, ready for use.

This guide is to run the model using image files that we have saved locally.

If your are going to take images check * [Enhancing Active Learning: Uploading Data to Roboflow from Raspberry Pi using the API](#enhancing-active-learning-uploading-data-to-roboflow-from-raspberry-pi-using-the-api) from this repo to see how use the camera in Raspberry Pi.


### Download the Roboflow Docker Container to the Pi
While we wait for our model to train, we can get things set up on our Raspberry Pi. To run our model on the Pi, we‚Äôre going to use the Roboflow inference server Docker container. This container contains a service that you can use to deploy your model on your Pi.

To use the model we built on a Pi, we‚Äôll first install Docker:

```
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
```

After Docker is installed, we can pull the inference server Docker container that we will use to deploy our model:

```
sudo docker pull roboflow/inference-server:cpu

```
The inference API is available as a Docker container optimized and configured for the Raspberry Pi. You can install and run the inference server using the following command:

```
sudo docker run -it --rm -p 9001:9001 roboflow/roboflow-inference-server-arm-cpu
```
ou can now use your Pi as a drop-in replacement for the Hosted Inference API (see those docs for example code snippets in several programming languages).

Next, install the Roboflow python package with pip install roboflow.

### Run Inference
To run inference on your model, run the following code, substituting your API key, workspace and project IDs, project version, and image name as relevant. You can learn how to find your API key in our API docs and how to find your workspace and project ID.


```
from roboflow import Roboflow

rf = Roboflow(api_key="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx")
project = rf.workspace().project("xxxxxxxx")
model = project.version(1).model

model.predict("your_image.jpg", confidence=40, overlap=30).save("prediction.jpg")

prediction = model.predict("example.jpg")
print(prediction.json())

prediction.save("output.png")
```

This code tells our Python package that you want to run inference using a local server rather than the Roboflow API. The first time you run this code, you will need to have an internet connection. This is because the Python package will need to download your model for use in the inference server Docker container.

After your model has been downloaded once, you can run the program as many times as you like without an internet connection.

Now, let‚Äôs make a prediction on an image!

We can retrieve a prediction from our model that shows hand is in this image with a blue rectangle like a labeled image, when we run the code, we see a JSON dictionary that contains the coordinates of the hand in our image.

<p align="center">
<img src="media/39.png" width="60%">
</p>

Our model is working! We can save an image that shows our annotated predictions, if we open up the file, we‚Äôll see these results:

<p align="center">
<img src="media/40.png" width="60%">
</p>

Right now, our model works using image files that we have saved locally. But, that doesn‚Äôt need to be the case. You could use the Roboflow Python package with a tool like the Raspberry Pi camera to take a photo every few seconds or minutes and retrieve predictions. Or you could use the Pi camera to run your model on a live video feed.

Conclusion
The Raspberry Pi is a small, versatile device on which you can deploy your computer vision models. With the Roboflow Docker container, you can use state-of-the-art YOLOv8 models on your Raspberry Pi.

Connected to a camera, you can use your Raspberry Pi as a fully-fledged edge inference device. Once you have downloaded your model to the device, an internet connection is not required, so you can use your Raspberry Pi wherever you have power.

Now you have the knowledge you need to start deploying models onto a Raspberry Pi. Happy building!

## Challenges I ran into and What I learned

One of the main challenges was to label with labelimg I didn't found a way to install it using Conda in Windows also the same in a virtual environment. After doing research I found how to download it in binary. 

The second main challenge was to run the Streamlit app in the Share hub, I have problems with the Pytorch version. The one I installed on my computer was not compatible with the platform and then it was missing the packages.txt. 

Finally, this is the first time I use Roboflow and Streamlit. In the end, I learned that whenever you may think that you found no way out, the motivation may help you to find alternative solutions with these resources.

## Observations about the project

The Share Streamlit Hub has only 1GB of memory to run apps so I need to be careful with what I deploy and also I try to run it in Heroku but it only gives me 500MB of memory so I couldn't run the app in Heroku. The images data set is hard to create because it is necessary to have images different from each other but with a webcam it is hard to get a variety of hands position. Also if hands position are similar can confuse some things. For this I would like to try PoseNet or MediaPipe to compare both.

Capturing images with the hands position could be hard doing more than 20 photos of a hand gesture. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

- Building a custom script to capture images and just change a few variables for each project
- Create a images data set
- Have a model with an accuracy of >90 %
- Learning new technologies in a record time
- Create a Live demo using Streamlit
- Start creating a tool that will help others

## What's next for Hands Spelling Recognition with Object detection

- Develop a hand posture reconcnition model with PoseNet and/or Mediapipe
- Upload images and annotations from AWS or GCP or Azure to Roboflow.
- Deploy Model in Raspberry Pi.
- Upload images from Raspberry Pi
- Add web cam and video object detection
